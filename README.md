- **Performance**: Out-of-the-box performance optimizations, including code splitting and image optimization.
- **Scalability**: Ideal for building both small and large-scale applications with a modular and maintainable architecture.
- **Developer Experience**: Hot-reloading, file-system routing, and powerful API routes make development fast and intuitive.
